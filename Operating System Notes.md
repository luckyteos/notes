**Caching**
> Copying information into a faster storage medium eg. from hard disk to main memory (RAM)

> Every layer in the memory serves as a cache for the layer beneath it

**Virtual Memory:** Concept of each process having their own separate memory space, which is independent of where the memory allocated for the process is actually stored on the main memory (RAM)
**Page:** Smallest unit of data in memory. Can be given privileges like No permission/R/RW

**User Mode/Kernel Mode**
